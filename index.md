# Some Knowledge & Views

Welcome to my page. My purpose here is to formulate my understanding of topics I am studying or working on.

## Data Science

It all starts with some data and a question. Is the question worth answering? How much money do we generate if we answer the question? Can we formulate the question in the language of machine learning, with a loss and a thresold for this loss? If so we can use ML techniques. We don't know what would work. Maybe we get some intuition with experience with similar taks. First, we try a simple model (baseline) and explore our results. Is it good enough? If not, we try better models? Are we losing the explainability? Maybe we can add more data. 

## Investing

Let's focus on stocks. We invest what we can lose... We don't trade often.
