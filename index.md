## Down in the subway

Early in the morning I walk in the calm and cool street. Then I rush into the gaping mouth of the giant subway. An endless maze of escalators plunges into the abyss of the city. Standing on a step, I can hardly stay awake. The mechanical roar of the machine is monotonous. Motionless I blend into the background. I forget that if the machine races, a step can turn into a chopper, a grid of razor blades. I breathe slowly. I become a machine in my turn. As I go down, others go up. But they are all masked. I only see their eyes shining. I finally arrive on a landing and walk down long corridors crossed by the blast of air conditioning. I hear footsteps. I walk again and walk past empty shops. Some are even closed. I go through the turnstiles. The beep of my pass echoes in the white. Another escalator. I reach the platform. I look around briefly. Others are also waiting for the train. I can feel their fear. I fear myself. Someone is coughing somewhere. All eyes turn. Fortunately the train arrives and I get into my wagon. I sit down and open the novel I'm reading those days. The stations follow each other every two minutes, with the precision of a Swiss clock. The stations are all painted in a bright color. Red follows green, then orange and blue. I don't have to look up to know where I am. At each stop the doors open, let in a little air, then close sadly. Immersed in my novel, my mind begins to wander, to travel. But suddenly the train stops dead. “I thought everything was automatic!” I say to myself. I can feel some movement in the adjacent wagons in the distance, but I refuse to be distracted and immerse myself in my novel. A few minutes pass. The lights go off. A sneeze! A scream! My book falls to the ground. I smell a burning smell. Suddenly a little flame grows and fills everything. I am flame. It's finished.
